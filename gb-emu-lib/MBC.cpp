MBC1 (max 2MByte ROM and/or 32KByte RAM)

This is the first MBC chip for the gameboy. Any newer MBC chips are working similiar, so that is
relative easy to upgrade a program from one MBC chip to another - or even to make it compatible to
several different types of MBCs.

Note that the memory in range 0000-7FFF is used for both reading from ROM, and for writing to the
MBCs Control Registers.

The Day Counter
The total 9 bits of the Day Counter allow to count days in range from 0-511 (0-1FFh). The Day
Counter Carry Bit becomes set when this value overflows. In that case the Carry Bit remains set

Note that you can store an offset to the Day Counter in battery RAM. For example, every time you
read a non-zero Day Counter, add this Counter to the offset in RAM, and reset the Counter to zero.
This method allows to count any number of days, making your program Year-10000-Proof, provided that
the cartridge gets used at least every 511 days.

Delays
When accessing the RTC Registers it is recommended to execute a 4ms delay (4 Cycles in Normal
