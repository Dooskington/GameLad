# GameLad

The [GameLad](http://www.dooskington.com/gamelad/) is a (relatively) fully featured gameboy emulator that I have been working on for a few months in conjunction with [TyrenDe](https://github.com/TyrenDe).

### Compiling

To compile on Windows, use the Visual Studio project. Currently, only VS2013 is supported.

To compile on Mac OSX, use make.

To compile on Linux, use make.  Note: You may need to pull down SDL2 manually using apt get or pacman.

### Dependencies

The project requires SDL2 to compile.
